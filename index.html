         <h2>About Me</h2>

         <p>I'm a Junior in high-school who enjoys working with computers; including hardware, and coding. I know p5.js and some HTML. p5.js is an open-source JavaScript library. I plan to pursue a future in programming. Most likely software development or web development. Game development is still something I'm interested in and looking at.</p>
         <p>I also enjoy gaming. Particularly organized competitive gaming, or esports. Ive participated in some seasons for high-school, and some D3 college level. More is listed below. I tend to play Overwatch but I am intrested in others and do enjoy some Mario Kart. </p>
         <p>Alongside that I'm also a big music connoisseur. I tend to listen to mostly metal, but do enjoy others. I like bands like Slipknot and Linkin Park. I do listen to a lot of others but those two are what I listen to the most.</p>
         <p>I've still got a long way to go, so much could change. But for now... this is me!</p>
